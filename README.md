# CXX Project Builder

**Author**: Shawn Kervin Emmanuel Joseph
**Company Name**: MLAB

## Overview

This project is a C++ project builder script. It creates the directory structure and essential files for a CMake-based C++ project. The script is designed to simplify the setup process, making it easier for developers to get started with their C++ projects.

## Project Structure

The project structure created by the script includes the following directories:

- `build`: This directory is for building the C++ project using CMake.
- `src`: The source code for the C++ project is placed here.
- `header`: This directory is meant for header files.

## Getting Started

1. Run the `CXX-Project-Builder` script.
2. Follow the prompts to provide a name for your C++ project.
3. The script will create the project directory structure, a `CMakeLists.txt` file, and a sample `main.cpp` file.
4. The project will be initialized as a Git repository, and an initial commit will be made.
5. The project will be opened in Visual Studio Code for further development.

## Usage

You can use this project builder to quickly set up the basics of your C++ projects. Customize the generated `CMakeLists.txt` and `main.cpp` files to match your project's requirements.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to improve the script or add new features. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue on this project's GitHub repository.
